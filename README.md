# LCARS-ExpressJS
An Express.js and EJS implimentaion of the LCARS interface implimented by Jim Robertus @ https://www.thelcars.com/

So far nothing has actually been implemented. It's simply the express/ejs boilerplate and TheLCARS assets. 

About me: I'm learning ExpressJS and EJS for work. I have very little idea about what I'm doing at this point. Keep that in mind before forking anything.

After cloning: 
    change directory:
    > cd LCARS-ExpressJS

    install dependencies:
    > npm install

    run the app from windows command prompt:
    > SET DEBUG=lcars-expressjs:* & npm start

    run the app from windows power shell:
    > $env:DEBUG='LCARS-Express:*'; npm start
